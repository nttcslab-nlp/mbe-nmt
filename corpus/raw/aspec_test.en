This paper described the new author's theory on glass transition point from crosslinked resin to linear polymer.
The author already reported the "New theory on physical properties of from crosslinked resin to linear polymer: melting point, glass transition point (Tg), and strength" in Journal of Applied Polymer Science (Vol. 97, 1467-1475 (2005)).
In the new theory, the author considered that since crosslinked resin forms different segment depending on the temperature during and after curing, its g also changes.
The author also considered that on condition that the jointing part of two rows bonded with van der Waals force between main chains is a segement, Tg of linear polymer is the temperature when thermal expansition of the C-C bond from 0℃ becomes 1%.
The following are described to explain the new theory: (1) elongation, (2) differences of Tg and segment between crosslinked resin and linear polymer, (3) relation between melting and molecular size, (4) relation between post-Tg and new segment, (5) handling of linear expansion coefficient.
Polonium drew attention in the end of the year 2006, when an ex‐KGB agent was abruptly and mysteriously killed allegedly because of polonium.

The complicated interaction between the immune system and PCV2 of pigs was outlined.
The evidence that PCV2 is a main pathogen in pigs in the adequate environment or the management condition was introduced.
The extensive stimulation of the immune system is an essential condition for induction of the pig multiorgan-underdeveloped after weaning syndrome(PMWS) in the PCV2-infected pigs.
And PCV2 itself is an indispensable pathogen for lethal PMWS.
In the PMWS-contracted pigs, the effective immunological response to the pathogens except for PCV2 is insufficient.
Based on the clinic, pathological, and immunological observations in the fields regarding the immunosuppressive condition in PMWS, PCV2 may be the important factor for the immunodeficiency which secondarily occurrs in some constant environments.

The virus inspection and immunoserologic inspection of BALF and blood plasma were carried out for 14 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients and of 8 patients hospitalized for IPF acute aggravation.
The cytokine which significantly increased in BALF in the acute aggravation stage compared with the IPF stable stage was high in 13 types out of 17 type measured, and especially IL-6, TNFα and IFNγ tended to be high in the poor prognosis cases.
In 3 cases of BALF reexamination during the acute aggravation treating process, IL-2, IL-5 and IL-6 showed decreasing tendencies by the treatment regardless of prognosis, and IL-8, IFNγ and TNFα showed the upward tendencies in the poor prognosis cases.
In the blood plasma, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8 and IL-10 significantly increased in the acute aggravation stage compared with the stable stage.
The basic disease state of bronchial asthma is chronic airway inflammation.
In airway inflammation, various cells such as eosinophils, T-cells, mast cells, neutrophils, macrophages and airway epithelium, and various liquid factors are involved.
It is taken seriously that Th2 cytokine is involved not only in central airway, but also in peripheral airway, in the position of airway inflammation.
In addition, the disease states of airway remodeling such as the peeling of tracheal epithelial cell and turning into embryonic cell, basal membrane thickening, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of tracheal smooth muscle, and angiogenesis are clarified, which bring about irreversible airway closure and chronically intensify airway anaphylaxia to cause the asthma to become serious and intractable.
For the treatment of asthma, it is important to introduce antiinflammatory drugs, mainly inhalation steroids, from the early stage, for the suppression of the remodeling of airway in addition to the control of allergic inflammation.
The features of bronchial asthma are repeated paroxysmal stridor, dyspnea and cough, which tend to appear at night and in early morning, and in the auscultation finding, the sound is continuous A, especially harmonic flute-like sound.
In addition, objective evaluation of air flow restriction by a respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of asthma.
It is evaluated by spirometry or peak flow meter, and airway hypersensitivity test is performed.
The evaluation of airway inflammation is performed by sputum test, measurement of nitrogen monoxide concentration in the expiration, expiration condensate measurement, and allergological examination.
The diseases which cause stridor and dyspnea, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, insufficiency of left heart and hyperventilation syndrome are the object of the differentiation.
What are important in the clinical diagnosis are, 1) that a symptom which derives from air flow restriction occurs paroxysmally and repeatedly, 2) that reversibility is shown, at least partially, in the air flow restriction, and 3) that other diseases are excluded.
As a result of our genetic analysis, the possibility that IL-17F gene fulfills an important role in the disease state of asthma is guessed.
PAI-1 may be deeply involved in the formation of airway remodeling, and the functional polymorphism of PAI-1 gene seems to be one of the genetic factors which regulate whether airway remodeling easily progresses or not.
CCL5 is a chemokine induced strongly from airway epithelium in viral infection, and especially, it may fulfil an important role for the acquisition of chronic airway inflammation in high-age asthma.
When the attention was paid to the role of macrophage inhibitory factor, it was guessed that natural immune system is deeply involved in the disease state of allergy.
From the above, the understanding of the disease was deepened by clarifying the pathophysiological common pathway at the molecular level.
By making these pathways to be a target, it is expected to contribute to the advance in the prevention and treatment of asthma.

Complementary medicines have effects to promote digestion and absorption and to improve metabolism postoperatively.
On 29 patients with acute pulmonary embolism, the time‐course inthe electrocardiogram was examned in the period from the time before manifestation to 1 month after manifestation.
The electrocardiograms were compared by dividing 13 patients, on whom the pulmonary arterial pressure was measured, into a high value group and a low value group in the systolic pulmonary arterial pressure.
The marked prolongation of the QT interval was observed in V1,2 after the day following the manifestation in comparison with that in the day of the manifestation.
In the paeitn with the high value of the pulmonary arterial pressure, the prolongation of the QT interval was more remarkable.
The prolongation of the QT interval in the right chest leads is thought to be useful as the index in grasping the pathological state of this disease.
The liver and intestine were extracorporeally observed through the central abdominal wall in the gestational age.
Hernia repair in the neonatal period and heart catheterization at the age of 3 were conducted due to a cardial murmur.
Two pairs of bilateral paravertebral veins substituted for feedback from the lower body and these were smaller than both primary azygous veins.
