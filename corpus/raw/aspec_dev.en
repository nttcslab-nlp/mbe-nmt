The authors measured the subcutaneous fat thickness of each body part of healthy adult men and women using 2 kinds of ultrasonic wave subcutaneous fat measuring instruments with different accuracy, and examined the effect of the difference in the accuracy of measuring instruments on the measured values.
The reliability of the measured values using measuring instruments made by Aloka Co. and Elk Co. was high, and difference in the measured values was not recognized.
However, at the parts where subcutaneous fat thickness was thin or complicated in the subcutaneous tissue, the possibility of the error of measured values due to difference in the accuracy was suggested.
There were little effects of the accuracy of measuring instruments on thorax, abdomen, ilium upper part, and overarm back, which were often used for the estimation formula, and the sexual specificity was also little.
Therefore, the measurement is similarly possible even though which measuring instrument is used.
However, there is the possibility in which the difference in the accuracy affects the error of the measured values on scapula lower and thigh outside.

For even smaller tea tortrixes the effect was recognized but to a little smaller extent.
The simple equipment for photographing the appearance of preparing powdered tea by the digital camera was developed, and the tea color was analyzed to become numerical, and the conditions for expressing "clearness" and steaming which were good were obtained.
Comparisons of the varieties of preparing powdered tea, the pluck cultivation method, the steaming degree and the clearness degree indicated that evaluation of the steaming degree reflected the result of operation of the steam heat.
Then the biregressive formula and the decisive counting of the steaming degree and the clearness were obtained.
Comparison and examination between the steaming degree in last year and the color information from the biregressive formula were performed.
The author has developed a mesh‐unit analysis method of static landscape images using the eye mark recorder as a direct determination method of characteristic visual behaviors to allow a quantitative evaluation of village landscapes.
As a result it became possible to quantify psychological evaluation of landscape from attention characteristic indexes such as diffusion of focus of attention and degree of concentration.
The degree of concentration became higher as the touch of village, favorable images and image fixation increased, while the diffusion of focus of attention decreased.
Analysis of the landscape images by setting landscape evaluation and visual cognition indexes respectively on ordinate and abscissa can lead to clarification of the relation among constituents within the images and landscape evaluation.
This paper introduces the research results on heat and drought stress resistance in the reproductive growth stage of snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris).
Under heat and drought stress, morphological and physiological differences in growth occur such as cultivation optimal timing, plant water physiology, and photosynthesis parameter, depending on genotype.
The water content of leaves is deeply related with heat and drought stress resistance.
Resistant cultivars suppress drop in leaf water content in heat and drought, by decreasing the growth of above-ground part and water potential of leaves.
Therefore, as the evaluation index of heat and drought stress resistance of this crop, the water content of leaves is more suitable than water potential.
The study aimed to collect and collate information on the development, production, and commercialization of recombinant plants for drugs, survey the present state of companies which develop the plants, and classify them for the purpose of contributing to the preparation of assessment standards for food safety.

In the natural forest of the cypress(Thujopsis dolabrata) of the basin of the Ohata River, Aomori Prefecture, which had been selectively felled 5 - 30 years before, the generating status of the seedling and sapling was investigated.
The selective felling was based on the execution method established by Mr. Kyosuke Matsukawa in 1935.
As a result, more than 5,000 seedlings/ha were confirmed even in every forest stand, after whose felling 5 years had passed.
Therefore, it was considered that the renewal had been sufficiently finished 5 years after felling.
And it was possible to grasp the renewal pattern of Thujopsis dolabrata with the time course.
Though hoof disease is abounding in the accident of disease and injury, other locomotorial disease is more frequent in the culling accident in lactating and beef cattle.
It is indicated that the hoof causes the injury of the other locomotorium.
In beef cattle, the change of the hoof influences the bone directly, affecting soft tissues.
In the meantime, in lactating dairy cow, the change of the hoof injures the soft tissue, and it shifts to the bone.
In the treatment of the hoof disease, it is desirable that the treatment interval is gradually extended after "biodynamic treatment" except for the infectious disease.
Sex pheromones are used as agricultural chemicals for pest control in three aspects of occurrence survey, mass attraction and killing, and communication disturbance.
Occurrence survey is done in order to predict optimum timing of insecticide spraying beforehand.
Pheromones do not kill female insects, but show an effect by catching a large number of male insects.
Synthetic pheromones are sprayed on the field so as to prevent mating by obstructing communication between male and female insects.

Seasonal variation of chlorophyll and nutrient salt at survey points in offing of Motta Cape, Hokkaido was surveyed to contribute to forecast of aquatic resource fluctuation and fishing ground formation.
Chlorophyll density along the coasts showed high level in April, while that offshore areas did not show remarkable seasonal fluctuation.
Its peak in spring was supposed to fall on April 〜 June due to decrease in nitrate content.
Nutrient salt showed high density in the winter.
The mass transfer phenomenon in a carrier is examined in lactic fermentation by immobilization lactic bacteria.
Simulation shows that storage of a growth inhibitor ( lactic acid in a free state ) is observed in the carrier.
In addition, peculiar diffusion behavior of the lactate ion is clarified.
That is, lactic acid in a free state and hydrogen ion are diffused outside from the inside of the carrier at the starting‐up stage of both batch and continuous fermentation, but lactate ion is diffused inside from the surface of the carrier.
This is to occur by addition of basic solution for controlling pH of the culture solution.
It is shown that the production rate of lactic acid is improved by utilizing a buffer instead of the basic solution to lower diffusing inside the lactate ion carrier.

Seedling raising box weight lightening techniques by mixing light artificial bed soil and mountain soil were examined for the elimination of raising box carrying task.
Artificial bed soil on market mixed of vermiculite and sphagnum peat and adjusted to pH 4.5 with phosphoric acid was tested.
This artificial bed soil with small weight per unit volume and high water holding capacity and phosphate content brought about a lightening of total weight of raising box and increasing in the water holding capacity and phosphate absorption by seedling with higher mixing ratio to mountain soil.
However, use of whole‐volume artificial bed soil is not practical because of lower seedling mat strength.
Artificial soil mixing ratio for practically optimal litening effects was 70% ensuring equivalent mat strength to that of whole‐volume mountain soil.
In 14 cases(6 men and 8 women, aged 23 - 80 years) of patients with the above pain, the effectiveness of weak galvanic stimulation(I) was evaluated from the pain threshold value estimated by the algesiometer, the change in the visual-sense analog score, and the patient's satisfaction degree.
The I was applied for a total of 10 minutes at 0.5 - 20 Hz and 300 μA, centering around the pressure spot.
The pain threshold value significantly rose after 10 minutes compared with the values shown before the treatment.
The visual-sense analog score was significantly lowered, and the patient's satisfaction was also good.
From the above, the I was considered to be effective for treatment of the above pain.
The verification as to whether the selection of recipients as well as the brain death decision were appropriately and properly carried out has been severely performed, but it can be scarcely said that sufficient consideration has been given to the feeling of the donor's family.
This study intended to carry out the groping on an ideal way of the mental care for the donor's family, considering this point.
The literature research which covered studies of this kind in foreign countries was carried out in this fiscal year.
The number of the papers concerning the mental care in the transplantations reported between 1966 and 2002 was 49 in all, but the objects of most researches were recipients among the research objects.
Since the reference result showed that there were two reports on the mental care for donors and only one report of 1998 on the mental care for donor's families, it was clarified how scanty the researches on the mental care for donors were even in foreign countries.
The origin of the airway remodeling due to airway inflammation was examined using the components in the airway local sputum of the toddler asthma in its crisis early stage.
As the result, in the bronchial asthma group who repeated the stridor, the MMP-9 concentration concerned in the airway remodeling was higher as compared with that in the first-time stridor group of the children who were later diagnosed as toddler asthma.
And this MMP-9 concentration in the first-time stridor group showed significant positive correlations with the ECP derived from eosinophils which were the airway inflammation mediators or the neutrophil elastase concentration derived from neutrophils.
It was indicated from the above result that the airway inflammation due to neutrophils as well as eosinophils from the suckling stage might have already been concerned in induction of the airway remodeling.
Branched IPMT is emitting the edge in the mucus pancreas cancer advocated by Ohashi et al. as pancreatic carcinoma with the good prognosis.
Though branched IPMT was confused by the pancreatic duct expansion form with the pancreas mucoid cyst tumor,it is widely known that these are different diseases by recognizing the interstitial tissue which resembles the ovarium.
And,the difference with carcinoma in situ(CIS)which is the precursor lesion of the pancreatic duct cancer of the infiltration becomes a discussion for this tumor,since it belongs to the tumor in the pancreatic duct.
Though expansion,mucus production,papillary proliferation of the pancreatic duct,etc.is important in the differentiation,there is some the differentiation on the difficult case.
The following were examined in spontaneous chronic pancreatitis of the male WBN/Kob rat: Its crisis and progression, the relation between apoptosis of pancreatic acinic cells and the T cells, and the therapeutic effect of tacrolimus.
At the age of 15 weeks, the CD4- and CD8-positive cells infiltrated the pancreatic leaflets or between the leaflets, and especially the CD8-positive T cells were located close to the pancreatic acinic cells with the apoptosis caused.
The apoptosis of the pancreatic acinic cells, the infiltration of the CD4- and CD8-positive cells, and the progression of pancreatitis were almost perfectly suppressed by administration of tacrolimus.
It was indicated that the CD8-positive T cells fulfiled an important role in induction of apoptosis of the pancreatic acinic cells and in progression of chronic pancreatitis, and tacrolimus could become a therapeutic drug for chronic pancreatitis.
The Fukukoukai Soumu Hospital opened as a mental care/complication ward on the occasion of the transfer to a new hospital in June, 2001.
A study was performed on the effect of this change in the environment, in the aspects such as the open counter, curtains positioned to maintain the space around the bed, or the relation with the nurse as the human environment.
As a result, the number of complaints of patients did not change much through a day.
It indicates that the specific weight on the limited nurses working at night or holidays is large.
It was recognized that the weight of the effect of human environment is large, and it is necessary to deal with by the ward as a whole, not only by each individual.
Also, it seems to be effective to prepare and utilize the physical, spacial and human environment according to the situation of the patient.
Regarding Surgical Margin to be ensured in hepatectomy for hepatic metastasis of colic cancer, more than 10 mm is recommended in part of the literature, but many cases were also experienced, in which it did not recur even when the hepatectomy was performed closest possible to the tumor unavoidably.
In the excision examples of esophageal cancer and liver cancer, the relationship between pathologic findings of the surrounding lymph nodes and the recurrence was examined.
Results: In order to completely prevent the stump relapse in the direction of hepatic parenchyma and the Glisson sheath in the hepatic metastatic excision of colic cancer, Surgical Margin of more than 5 mm is recommended, but it seemed that in more than 95% of the cases even Margin of more than 2 mm was sufficient.
However, the progress in the Glisson sheath direction tends to be slightly wide, and the attention is needed.
On the 3- to 4-year-old infants attending the metropolitan private nursery, the daily work of the life in the garden and how to play, namely the effect of the nurture program on the infant activity, were analyzed in detail.
And the relation between the lifestyle habit and the activity in the home was also analyzed.
By the activity quantity measurement using the active tracer, it was proven that the activity was being averaged with other infants in the group life.
It restricts the activity of active infants and promotes the activity of ordinary infants.
It was considered that it was necessary to adopt the outside play or to elevate the activity content in the room in order to increase the activity quantity per day.
The purpose of the examination was to confirm the safety and the effectiveness of the mini-transplantation for malignant hematologic disease.
In the hope of improvement of the prognosis in a poor prognosis case of malignant lympoma, the mini-transplantation was enforced for the case who had the HLA-compatible sibling and from whom the informed consent could be obtained.
The malignant lymphoma-related diseases were also indicated, and multiple myeloma and ATLL also became the objects.
The side effect of conditioning of treatment of the mini-transplantation and GVHD were slight, and the positive conversion of CMV-Ag by delay of the hemopoietic recovery and unrecovery of the immune strength after transplantation was frequently recognized, but in general the treatment was secure.
Regarding the usefulness, the follow-up study on the future long-term prognosis is necessary.
The progress of 2 cases in therapy for pruritus cutaneous probably triggered by stress was reported.
There was the onset of pruritus cutaneus in Case 1 because of the stressed situation with the divorce problem and family relationship.
The case was relieved from prutitus cutaneous in a fairly short period, yet requiring to attend a psychosomatic medical clinic.
The stress in work seemed to trigger pruritus cutaneous in Case 2.

As examinations for fulminant hepatitis and the relationship disease, examinations for hepatitis viral marker, degree of hepatonecrosis, and hepatic reserve are important.
According to new pathological classification, fulminant hepatitis and late onset hepatic failure (LOHF) are classified into viral, autoimmune, drug-induced, agnogenic, and unclassified.
The cause is closely related to the prognosis, and the lifesaving rate is low in hepatitis B virus carrier and autoimmune case.
The degree of hepatonecrosis is diagnosed based on the serum transaminase concentration.
Prothrombin time and total bilirubin concentration are useful for the evaluation of the hepatic reserve.
Though in the congenital biliary dilatation, the expansion of intrahepatic bile duct can be produced in addition to the expansion of common bile duct, cholangiectasis defined as a intrahepatic bile duct is rare.
In this paper, disease state ( Caroli disease ) which showed the expansion mainly on intrahepatic bile duct peripheral side which Caroli reported was outlined, and it described the relation of the carcinogenesis.
First, concept and etiology of Caroli disease were described, and clinical feature and pathological form of Caroli disease were described.
Next, background factor of the carcinogenesis of the intrahepatic bile duct cancer was described, and the mechanism in which bile duct epithelial dysplasia by the intrahepatic calculosis occurred also described corresponding possibility for the carcinogenesis of Caroli disease.
Finally, the intrahepatic bile duct cancer was recognized, after the liver transplantation for Caroli disease was carried out, and the case ( 58-year-old women ) diagnosed as intrahepatic bile duct cancer it infiltrates to the bile duct which complicated Caroli disease, was presented.
CA19-9 is known to be highly specific for pancreatic carcinoma and biliary tract cancer, but it also shows high values in the advanced cases of gastric cancer or colorectal cancer.
The reported case of CA19-9 producing gastric adenocarcinoma was in a 69-year-old woman, examined in our hospital with hematemesis as a chief complaint.
In the examination finding on admission, obvious rises of CEA and CA19-9 were recognized, it was diagnosed as differentiated adenocarcinoma from upper digestive tract endoscopic finding, and total gastrectomy, splenectomy, cholecystectomy and lymphadenectomy were performed.
In the postoperative immunohistological finding, the cytoplasm of the cancer cell was strongly positive for CEA stain and CA19-9 stain.

In addition, liver transplantation for adult biliary atresia is described.
Recognition of expression and emotion are basic functions of human relations, and they are very important in the social life.
Though emotional reaction is said to be expressed as an autonomic nerve reaction, the expression is distinguished in communicating with others in a moment, and emotional reaction may be produced.
The recognition dysfunction is advocated as a symptom of schizophrenia, and the effect of understanding of the expression and emotion is also important.
The closing one's eyes reaction time when showing the photograph of "cry" and "laugh" of the baby for schizophrenic was observed.
With the use of recombinant restricted nucleocapsid protein, we developed ELISA method to detect specific SARS coronavirus-specific IgM antibody (MAC-ELISA).
The study result showed that MAC-ELISA was able to detect SARS coronavirus with 100% specificity, suggesting its usability in diagnosis.
Using a series of blood samples collected from SARS patients, we determined how long it would take to get seroconversion.
The result showed that it would take median 8 days to get IgM seroconversion, and 100% seroconversion was observed within 3 weeks.
As for IgG, it took median 11 days to get seroconversion.
Seroconversion of IgM occurs faster than IgG.
Since neutralizing test uses live SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), biologically contained facility (BSL3) is required.
We created VSV-SARS-St19, a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus pseudo type bearing spike glycoprotein (S protein).
Because this pseudo-type virus cannot replicate, it is safe in an aspect of biological containment.
